# Change Log

Notable changes are logged here by release. This project is not
expected to be especially active and follows a simplified Semantic Versioning:

- Version numbers take the format X.Y
- X is associated with major API breakage / changes in algorithm and results.
- Y is associated with minor updates and improvements
- Small amounts of code tidying, refactoring and documentation do not
  lead to a new release, and simply sit on the Development branch of
  the Git repository.

The changelog format is inspired by [keep-a-changelog](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog).
